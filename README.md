the followig commands:

# Using RandorAssistant
To use Randor Assistant, download the repository,
install the required packages, and run the main.py. 
Say, "Randor" (ran-door), in order to communicate with 
the device. Feel free to add suggestions, or make improvements 
if you wish to Randor. This is being made for my own 
interest in learning to make a smart assistant,and was 
not inteded for anything more. 

# Current Commands to RandorAssistant
- Some of the "conversational" commands can be found in the commonTalk.json file
- You can also ask it for the time or for the weather, (also still in development on weather, as it just needs to parse location. Currently there are a couple example locations which are hard coded for example purposes, but are to be removed later).

# Purpose:
The purpose of this smart assistant is to allow for users to chat
with the smart assistant and allow the user to scrape the web for
any data that may be needed. This way, users can get data to
start creating applications instantly. Currently, this is some
example code to get started on creating a smart assistant. The web
scraping is still in development and the chatbot will need to continue 
to improve.
